# Ruby Bank Balance
Create a program to ask the user how much they would like to withdraw from a bank account with a balance of £500. 
If the amount is mor than £0 and less than £500 it will subtract the amount from the original balance and advise a new balance. 
If not, the program will advise that the withdrawl must not be more than the current balance.
